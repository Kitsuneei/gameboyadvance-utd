# GBA Emulator
This project is our Capstone Project for CS4485, focusing on developing a GameBoy Advance (GBA) emulator using the C programming language. The Game Boy Advance (GBA) is a 32-bit handheld video game console developed and released by Nintendo in 2001. The GBA features a 15-bit color display and a 32-bit CPU, making it one of the most powerful handheld gaming devices of its time. Emulating the GameBoy Advance presents a challenge because of the requirement to precisely duplicate its internal hardware, such as the BIOS, file save system, and sound integration, to ensure proper functioning.

Our project requires a comprehensive understanding of computer architecture, system integration, and strict adherence to specifications. It provides an in-depth look into the GBA hardware and the software emulation process. By creating this emulator, we aim to preserve the legacy of the GBA and enable others to play its classic games on modern devices.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the emulator up and running on your local machine.

TBD
