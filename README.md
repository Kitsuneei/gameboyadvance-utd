# GBA Emulator
Our project aims to develop a GameBoy Advance (GBA) emulator using the C programming language. The GBA, a handheld device released in 2001, features a 32-bit CPU and a 15-bit color display. The challenge of emulating the GBA lies in accurately replicating its internal hardware, including the BIOS and save states, which are crucial for its proper functioning. This project will require a deep understanding of computer architecture, system integration, and strict adherence to specifications. Additionally, it will provide an opportunity to delve into the intricacies of the GBA and its hardware, as well as the process of software emulation. By creating this emulator, we hope to preserve the legacy of the GBA and allow gamers to experience its classic games on modern devices. Furthermore, this project will also serve as a valuable learning experience for those interested in computer science and software engineering.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the emulator up and running on your local machine.

TBD

## Controls
The following are the default controls for the emulator:
- D-Pad: Arrow Keys
- A: Z
- B: X
- Select: Enter
- Select: Backspace
